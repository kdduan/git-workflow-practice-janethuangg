# "Do you have any questions?"

Interviews are two-way conversations – they're opportunities for the company to get to know you and your skills, and and they're opportunities for you to get to know the company better. While there is generally no such thing as a "bad" question, <b>it is oftentimes a red flag when a candidate has no questions at the end of the interview</b>. Moreover, not all questions are equal – some may lead to more insightful and interesting conversations.

[This](https://jvns.ca/blog/2013/12/30/questions-im-asking-in-interviews/) blog post compiles a list of questions you can ask when interviewing, and I personally found it be a great resource when I was recruiting. It offers plenty of inspiration for questions, and it encourages you to evaluate various aspects of a company/team, from its engineering practices to its management style. Whether you're currently looking for a new job or looking to switch to a new team, I would recommend reading over the blog post!
